# Story 6.6: Production Deployment & Monitoring

**Epic:** Epic 6 - Testing & Deployment  
**Story ID:** 6.6  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 8 Story Points  
**Sprint:** Sprint 10-11 (Week 13-15)

---

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** the application deployed to production with basic monitoring,  
**so that** users can access the MVP and issues can be detected

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Production server setup:
   - VPS or cloud instance provisioned (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS EC2)
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Firewall configured (ports 80, 443, 22)
   - Domain name configured and DNS pointed to server
2. Application deployed:
   - Production docker-compose running
   - Database initialized and migrated
   - SSL/TLS certificate installed (Let's Encrypt)
   - Environment variables configured
   - Uploads directory created and writable
3. Basic monitoring setup:
   - Application logs collected (stdout â†’ file or service)
   - Health check endpoints monitored
   - Uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
   - Alerts configured for downtime
4. Backup strategy:
   - Database backup script created
   - Daily automated backups configured
   - Backup retention policy: 7 days
5. Documentation:
   - Deployment runbook created
   - Rollback procedure documented
   - Monitoring dashboard access documented
6. Application accessible at production URL
7. Smoke tests pass on production

---

## Technical Notes

- Use Let's Encrypt with Certbot for SSL
- Use logrotate for log management
- Use cron for backup automation
- Store backups off-server (S3, Backblaze, etc.)
- Document server access and credentials securely

---

## Dependencies

- Story 6.4 (Production Docker must exist)
- Story 6.5 (CI/CD pipeline must work)

---

## Testing Requirements

- Verify application accessible via HTTPS
- Verify SSL certificate valid
- Verify monitoring alerts work
- Test backup and restore
- Run smoke tests

---

- [ ] Server provisioned and configured
- [ ] Application deployed
- [ ] SSL certificate installed
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Backups automated
