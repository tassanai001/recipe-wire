# Story 6.7: Performance Testing & Optimization

**Epic:** Epic 6 - Testing & Deployment  
**Story ID:** 6.7  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimate:** 5 Story Points  
**Sprint:** Sprint 10-11 (Week 13-15)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to verify application performance meets targets,  
**so that** users have a fast and responsive experience

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Performance benchmarks defined:
   - Homepage load time: < 2 seconds (First Contentful Paint)
   - Recipe detail page load: < 2 seconds
   - Search response time: < 500ms
   - API response time: < 200ms (p95)
2. Performance testing tools configured:
   - Lighthouse CI for frontend performance
   - k6 or Apache Bench for API load testing
3. Performance tests executed:
   - Lighthouse tests on key pages
   - Load tests on API endpoints (100 concurrent users)
   - Database query performance analyzed
4. Optimization implemented:
   - Frontend: image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading
   - Backend: database query optimization, indexes verified
   - Caching headers configured
5. Performance targets met:
   - Lighthouse scores: Performance > 90, Accessibility > 95
   - API load test: 95th percentile < 200ms
   - No N+1 query issues
6. Performance monitoring in production:
   - Lighthouse CI runs on every deploy
   - Performance metrics logged

---

## Technical Notes

- Use Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
- Use k6 for load testing (write test scripts)
- Use Prisma query logging to identify slow queries
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use React.lazy() for code splitting

---

## Dependencies

- Story 6.6 (Production deployment must exist)
- All previous stories (need complete application)

---

## Testing Requirements

- Run Lighthouse on all key pages
- Run load tests on all API endpoints
- Analyze database queries
- Verify optimizations improve scores
