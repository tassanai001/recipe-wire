# Story 1.1: Initialize Monorepo Structure

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Project Setup & Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.1  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 3 Story Points  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured monorepo with workspace management,  
**so that** I can develop frontend and backend applications with shared packages efficiently

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo initialized with pnpm workspaces
2. Directory structure follows architecture specification:
   - `apps/frontend/` - Next.js application
   - `apps/backend/` - NestJS application
   - `packages/types/` - Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas
   - `packages/utils/` - Shared utilities
   - `packages/ui/` - Shared UI components (placeholder)
3. Root `package.json` configured with workspace references
4. TypeScript configured with strict mode and path aliases
5. ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code style
6. Git repository initialized with `.gitignore` configured

---

## Technical Notes

- Use pnpm for package management
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Configure path aliases: `@recipe-wire/types`, `@recipe-wire/utils`, `@recipe-wire/ui`

---

## Dependencies

- None (First story)

---

## Testing Requirements

- Verify workspace structure is correct
- Verify pnpm workspace commands work
- Verify TypeScript path aliases resolve correctly
- Verify ESLint and Prettier run without errors

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Monorepo structure created
- [ ] pnpm workspaces configured
- [ ] TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
